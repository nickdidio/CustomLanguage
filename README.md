# CustomLanguage

Created a custom programming language through the use of the functional language OCaml.
The language can be run through an ubuntu terminal with either in line programming or throuhg a file read.
The language contains many of the necessary primary abilities that are needed to actually program such as different variable types, with int, string, double, coords, trees, lists, and pairs implemented. 
Various functions are available for each variable type. 
As well as this, type checking has been implemented to ensure less runtime errors. 
Basic arithmetic functions such as +, -, /, *, %, etc have also been added.
Functions are also able to be created within the language, with return statements, parameters, etc, with the option for recursion.
